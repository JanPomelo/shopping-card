# Rick and Morty Fake Shop

## Description

This is a fake shop site where you can book hours with all Rick and Morty characters in exchange for Flurbos (the currency in the Rick and Morty series). It includes a shopping card and the possibility to delete bookings.

## Motivation & Lessons Learned

This project was done for the The Odin Project curriculum in the React Course, where the task was to build a shop website. The focus during this project was on learning and getting familiar with React Router and deepen the knowledge with React Hooks. Furthermore the use of APIs was required. On top of that, I used Sass and CSS modules for the first time in a React project. It was a very helpful project, even though it took me half an eternety and I didn't really like the shop idea behind that. I restarted the project several times and had my troubles with it.
